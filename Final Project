For my project I wanted to create a beer pong game with the robotic arm throwing the ping pong ball into the cup.  
The robotic  arm wasnt able to launch the ball fast enough so i decided to switch the project to using the robotic arm 
to hit the ball into the cup in a type of golf game.  I couldn't get some aspects of the arduino code to work but if I work
on it a little more I should be able to make it actually fully functional.
